# Junior Engineer, Exchange Connectivity (Python) {Hong Kong Only}

## Company Background

Parallel Capital is an algorithmic, high frequency proprietary trading firm that specializes in providing liquidity within the cryptocurrency markets.

We’re a major though under-the-radar player in the cryptocurrency market making ecosystem, founded by industry veterans from both Wall Street and Silicon Valley in a melding of finance and tech. With over 35+ years of combined experience, we profitably trade tens of billions per month, outperforming much larger and better funded teams, and we are expanding rapidly.

To put this in context: we trade 1% of the entire crypto industry's volume daily. If we were a retail exchange (think Coinbase or Binance), we would be ranked #5 on any given day in total trading volume and trade more than Gemini and Bittrex combined.

We value constant learning, continuous improvement, fast iteration, and relentless resourcefulness. We focus on results, not effort. We embrace the sharing of ideas with an open mind and engage in healthy debate to evaluate them from first principles.

## Role and Responsibilities

We’re seeking a junior engineer with some Python experience to help us integrate with new exchanges, through a variety of technologies: REST API for order placement and cancellation, Websocket connections for streaming order book data and account updates, and even FIX.

Ideally you should have experience with these types of exchange integrations (even if it's just your own trading scripts), but any recent grad or budding engineer with experience using REST APIs/Websockets/FIX and interest in cryptocurrency trading are encouraged to apply. We have a template and playbook already for these integrations so the domain expertise is less essential - the most important things are a willingness to learn fundamental software engineering best practices (DRY, Single Responsibility Principle, state management, dependency injection) and strong communication skills.

## Expectations

We deeply believe in an iterative process when developing software and as a result we expect a tight feedback loop - frequent communication, asking questions when there are any uncertainties or tradeoffs to be made, and front footing anything unexpected are all strongly encouraged and highly valued.

## Qualifications

### Requirements
* Experience/curiosity about cryptocurrency trading.
* Some experience with Python 3 and REST APIs.
* Know best practices on how to use Git and Github, especially around pull requests and code reviews.
* Existing open source projects or contributions / sample code to demonstrate code quality.
* Some baseline background knowledge about finance (you know about bids and asks in an order book, etc.)

### Bonuses / Nice to Haves
* Strong understanding of async event loops in Python (either via asyncio or gevent).
* Experience with FIX.


## Apply!

If this sounds like you, please apply by sending your Github/Gitlab/sample projects, cover letter, and resume to careers@parallelcapital.co.

Non-standard applicants/applications are welcome; resumes are not strictly needed since the goal is to show off who you are and what you've done already that makes you a good fit!
