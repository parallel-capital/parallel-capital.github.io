# VP of Engineering

## Company Background

Parallel Capital is an algorithmic, high frequency proprietary trading firm that specializes in providing liquidity within the cryptocurrency markets.

We’re a major though under-the-radar player in the cryptocurrency market making ecosystem, founded by industry veterans from both Wall Street and Silicon Valley in a melding of finance and tech. With over 35+ years of combined experience, we profitably trade tens of billions per month and we are expanding rapidly.

To put this in context: we trade 1% of the entire crypto industry's volume daily. If we were a retail exchange (think Coinbase or Binance), we would be ranked #5 on any given day in total trading volume.

We value constant learning, continuous improvement, fast iteration, and relentless resourcefulness. We focus on results, not effort. We embrace the sharing of ideas with an open mind and engage in healthy debate to evaluate them from first principles.

## Role and Responsibilities

We’re seeking a VP of Engineering to help lead the development and maintenance of our trading systems. You’ll be executing a combination of both management and individual contributions, so this role is perfect for someone who enjoys management but still wants to code as well. Your day to day tasks will include:

* Understanding the system holistically and ensuring individual pieces act in concert with each other.
* Communicating frequently and clearly between the trading and technology teams to ensure that there is a deep understanding of current and future requests and preparing the groundwork for potentially executing upcoming requests.
* Making good tradeoffs between business needs and engineering needs, focusing on allocating resources to the initiatives that will actually have a positive impact on the company.
* Facilitating the shipping of features at both high velocity and reliability by building culture, systems, and processes that enable our engineers to consistently deliver multiple concurrent projects on time within the organizational constraints.
* Ensuring prompt responses to urgent issues that are revenue impacting.
* Building strong relationships with team members.
* Mentoring and leading technical team members by example.
* Ensuring that team members have the resources and support they need to succeed.
* Understanding existing team member personalities, strengths and weaknesses and being able to assign tasks and manage their career development appropriately.
* Troubleshooting difficult and complex technical problems with potential side effects.
* Diagnosing and pinpointing areas of latency in the system for optimizations.
* Enforcing engineering best practices including but not limited to code cleanliness, documentation, etc.
* Proposing effective refactoring projects to clean up remaining troublesome areas of the system while incurring minimal technical risk.
* Architecting/designing, debugging/troubleshooting, and monitoring high performance, low latency systems.

No prior cryptocurrency or finance knowledge is required, as we are happy to provide education and training in those areas but a strong engineering background is absolutely essential for success in this role and an interest in cryptocurrency is highly recommended.

## Expectations

We deeply believe in an iterative process when building and exploring technology and as a result we expect a tight feedback loop - frequent communication, asking questions when there are any uncertainties, pointing out tradeoffs to be made, and front footing anything unexpected are all strongly encouraged and highly valued.

The ideal candidate:

* Prefers simplicity and likes to take a lean and iterative approach to solving problems.
* Has good taste in engineering choices; explains and makes wise tradeoffs to balance realistic pragmatism in achieving business requirements.
* Uses a deeply data-backed approach to decision making.
* Embraces 80/20 pragmatic thinking.
* Ruthlessly practices pragmatism to achieve results.
* Thrives in a culture of passionate learning and teaching.
* Loves to reflect on challenges and improve process and tooling iteratively.
* Looks beyond the surface to identify and understand root causes and seek to resolve those instead of only addressing the symptoms.
* Exhibits obsessive attention to detail and sweats the small things, knowing that they compound to contribute to a more holistic experience by all stakeholders.
* Understands the importance of good documentation and is proactive and consistent about recording clear and useful information as well as making it readily available to other team members and external consumers.

## Qualifications

### Requirements

* 5+ years of deep industry experience with at least one of Python, Golang, Rust.
* Bachelor's degree in CS or related, firm understanding of data structures and algorithms.
* 1+ years experience managing a (ideally remote) team.
* Proven track record of results in a high performance environment.

## Benefits

Strongly above market compensation, with potentially significant bonuses commensurate with performance.

Work with smart, motivated, like-minded peers who you can teach and learn from to grow together.

We deeply believe in professional development and are supportive in ensuring personal and professional growth.

You’ll be joining a very small team with no bureaucracy or politics and get to work directly with the founders. https://github.com/hanchang/manager-readme
