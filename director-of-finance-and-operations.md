# Director of Finance and Operations

## Company Background

Parallel Capital is an algorithmic, high frequency proprietary trading firm that specializes in providing liquidity within the cryptocurrency markets.

We’re a major though under-the-radar player in the cryptocurrency market making ecosystem, founded by industry veterans from both Wall Street and Silicon Valley in a melding of finance and tech. With over 35+ years of combined experience, we profitably trade tens of billions per month, outperforming much larger and better funded teams, and we are expanding rapidly.

To put this in context: we trade 1% of the entire crypto industry’s volume daily. If we were a retail exchange (think Coinbase or Binance), we would be ranked between #5-8 on any given day in total trading volume.

We value constant learning, continuous improvement, fast iteration, and relentless resourcefulness. We focus on results, not effort. We embrace the sharing of ideas with an open mind and engage in healthy debate to evaluate them from first principles.

## Role and Responsibilities

We're seeking an experienced Director of Finance and Operations to own cross-functional operational initiatives covering various financial and operational aspects of the business, including but not limited to strategic and corporate finance, corporate structuring, regulatory navigation, solving complex multi-jurisdictional tax and accounting questions, and automating financial processes. You will be co-designing, owning and implementing strategic initiatives as well as building the core finance and operational functions to scale.

This is an incredibly unique opportunity to be part of a market leading startup in crypto, but to be explicit - we are looking for a practitioner, not a consultant. Just like everyone else in the company, you will focus on doing whatever needs to be done to build the company, so we expect you to be very practical and hands-on! Pure strategy or high level goals are not enough, you must possess the execution skills to carry out your vision.

Examples of Initiatives:

Corporate Structuring: designing and executing the setup of efficient corporate structures across multiple entities, businesses and jurisdictions

Finance Operations: cost of capital and loan capital optimization, trading operations including settlement

Account Setup: create and KYC accounts on new trading venues we are expanding to

Legal and regulatory: supporting relevant license applications, contract design and automation, compliance processes design, developing own expertise and challenging external advisors

Back Office Operations: set up and scale various financial processes such as automating of reporting & controls, introduction of relevant software tools, accounting and HR systems

Investor Relations: Creation of investor updates, investor audits
